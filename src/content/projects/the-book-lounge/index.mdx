The site is a single page built using Gatsby that pulls in and links to social media accounts.

I had a nicer way of doing the 2 image effects using CSS filters on the single image. Unforunatly Edge had a hard time rendering the filtered images as the contet moved and I had to restort to 3 seperate images.
